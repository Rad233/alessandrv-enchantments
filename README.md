# Alessandrv's Enchantmets
As of now the mod adds 12 new vanilla-like enchantments. Some are really basic like giving night vision on an helmet but that makes just sense to me.

This is my first mod so any feedback or suggestion is greatly appreciated!


With Cloth Config and the mod menu implementation you can set all enchantments values and even disable them if needed!

 

Requires the [Fabric-api](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api "fabric-api") and [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config "ClothConfig")
